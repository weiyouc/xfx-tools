新分享 is a data-driven company that offer loan matching and risk management services to the clients. 

OmniTek.Ai plans to provide two AI initiatives that helps them to land AI technologies within 新分享.

Scenario 1: 
When a BD brings up a new project, there is a lot of paperwork that needs handling/process before it goes up for formal approval. 新分享 needs a simpler way to handle this type of scenarios

Scenario 2"
The Data Science team at 新分享 works under a lot of pressure as they often deal with "fires" to explain data fluctuations. They would like to have something similar to the Google data science lab UX so that they can quickly identify the root cause for data fluctuation thus lifting the team efficiency and morale

OmniTek.ai would like to provide these two tools to 新分享 so that they can get some first-hand experience with the new AI technologies in their day-to-day business practices. 

For these two tools, OmniTek would like to charge 新分享 RMB 300K each, that include all necessary hardware and software as a turnkey solution. The project will last 3 months, and 新分享 needs to pay 50% upfront, and 50% upon the project completion. 新分享 also needs to inject 2 BD resources and 1 tech resource to work with OmniTek.ai to design and land these two tools within 新分享.

If both are successful, the two companies will further explore more AI based scenarios together down the road
